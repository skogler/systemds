The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number).  But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that.  If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly changable.  But it is strictly software.  Gordon Lang"

This sense creates drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about (here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/ touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring. At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because ""football has more action than baseball"".   ========================================================================= Steve Conroy			| conroy@terminus.saic.com	|  ""I'm gone, man - solid gone!  				| Science Applications		|		-Baloo International Corporation	| ========================================================================="

What is the rule that qualifies > a pitcher as making a save? >  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or beyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game. 	For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So, there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save and Clemens would get the win.

I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey. Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period  ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey something like 30 minutes later.

Feel free to email questions or further comments.  -- Burt Kaliski RSA Laboratories ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \documentstyle[12pt]{article} \begin{document}  \title{On ``Pseudocollisions'' in the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm} \author{Burton S. Kaliski Jr. \\ {\tt burt@rsa.com} \and Matthew J.B. Robshaw \\ {\tt matt@rsa.com} \and RSA Laboratories \\ 100 Marine Parkway \\ Redwood City, CA  94065} \date{April 23, 1993}  \maketitle  A message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a ``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the digest is easy, finding a message with a given digest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the same digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms have many applications, including digital signatures and message authentication.  RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron Rivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest. Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a second.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved} secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps to a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$ operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.  Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's internal compression function, which maps a 512-bit message block $x$ and a 128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output state. They show how to find a message block $x$ and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach exploits structural properties of the collision function to find  a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one would expect.  Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of MD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real collision, since it involves two different messages, would almost always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same message blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are the same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.  It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in MD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.  \bibliographystyle{plain} \begin{thebibliography}{1}  \bibitem{den-boer-md5} Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers. \newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}. \newblock In {\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993. \newblock Preprint.  \bibitem{rfc-md5} R.L.

If >that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything >on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify >or refute this?  You are correct (several times). TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the  standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect  that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be  exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic  field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.  Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the  printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the  crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some  intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential  sources of leaked information.  Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection  becomes an important security hazard.  In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns,  particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST  threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the  'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release'  for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to  approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat"" is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.  ------------------------ Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu> Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA"

They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there for and took a history, all before I undressed.   Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time?

Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?  ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu"

PURPOSE OF THE NEWSGROUP:  ========================      The following are the main purposes this group shall achieve:      i)    To highlight the common beliefs of all major religions            and philosophical traditions as they relate to Ahmadiyya            Muslim Community.      ii)   To discuss the doctrines, origin and teachings the Ahmad-           iyya Muslim Community, a dynamic world-wide movement.      iii)  To expound Islamic teachings and beliefs in the Holy            Quran and Islamic traditions from the Ahmadiyya Islamic           perspective.      iv)   To emphasize and discuss the similarities between Ahmadi            Muslims and followers of other religions of the world and            to explore how understanding and respect for each other's           faith can be brought about to eliminate religious intol-           erance and malice among people of all religious and phil-           osophical traditions.                v)    To look into the origin and teachings of all religions in           general and of Islam and Ahmadiyya Muslim Movement in par-           ticular, and to use the commonality of origin to foster           better understanding among Ahmadi Muslims and other people           and to promote an acceptance of universality of fundamental           rights to the freedom of conscience.      vi)   To point out current world problems and suggest solutions            to these problems, as offered by different religions and            systems of ethical philosophies.      vii)  To investigate the implications of science on religion            with particular emphasis on the Ahmadi Muslim perspective,           but with openness to dialogue with people of all religions           and philosophical traditions with reasoned positions as to           the relationship between religion and empirical science,           logic, and scientific ethics.                 viii) To exchange important news and views about the Ahmadiyya           Muslim Community and of other religions.      ix)   To add diversity to the existing religious newsgroups pre-             sent on Usenet in the interest of promoting a forum for           decorous dialogue.       x)    To inquire why religious persecution is on the rise in the           world and suggest solutions to remedy the ever deterior-           ating situation in the world in general and in the Islamic           world in particular.       xi)   To commemorate the contributions to humanity, society and           world peace made by the founders and followers of all           religions in general and by the International Ahmadiyya           Muslim community in particular.   TYPE:  ====  The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue. The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement, dissent, or  controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather, the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga- tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter.   The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:  Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu> Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>    A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM: ===============================================           The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to  be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the  fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.          The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of  divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to  openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns  against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail.          Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds.          The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood.   NEWSGROUP CREATION:  ==================          The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more ""YES/Create"" votes than ""NO/don't create"" votes; the newsgroup shall be created.    ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER:  ====================          Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora- do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party.  QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS: =====================          Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to:      Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>          Any questions or problems in voting should be sent to:      Anthony Lest    <lest@ucsu.colorado.edu>"

A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.   I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree. I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it.     >> I assumed that any humane >> person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents >> gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. > >A ""humane person"" who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old >would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm; >Ignorance is our greatest enemy. >  Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined as ""a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths.""  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational.   >>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence >                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >What _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their >data?  These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts. >Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report... > Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990""   Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"".   Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990.""   Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988.""   Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion.  I really don't want to do that.   >> or the Centers for Disease Control. >         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >They have firearm statistics?  Are firearms a disease? >  Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC. They don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you, interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.   >> that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. > >In ""the lives of youths"" or in their schools?

In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1 sentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here??? You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn't. > >> The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that >> 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year. > >I wouldn't trust their statistics without *independent* verification. > >> The CDC estimates >> that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once >> in 1990. > >Based on CPHV statistics?

As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot.   Believe me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.   ########################################################################### Rodney W.

NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting in any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious. THAT was my point to Joe who said that ""anti-gunners"" try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem. No, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't say that tired old NRA line ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"". Sure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient.

I'm not saying if that is a good thing or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program, they say ""well no...""  So, in answer to your question, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are essentially saying ""look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community"". If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.   >> >> >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or >> >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are >> >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often >> >>""borrowed"" from a parent without their knowledge. >> > >> >I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these ""statistics"" - I >> >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >> >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >> >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >> >who carry a gun to school daily. >> > >>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence >> or the Centers for Disease Control.

Will anybody  A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia,  and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag  is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with  no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides  the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and  the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which  renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or  her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event  could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case  to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis,  or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?                   An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives  of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection  of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over  the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.   One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent  events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we  are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic  Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the  neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their  colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.  		THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                  KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                  OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR   ""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.""  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.""  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.""  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.""  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back.""  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.""  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Grief-stricken relatives in  the town of Agdam  (right) weep over the  coffin of another of the massacre victims. Calculating the final death toll has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24 hours.

Let's keep the land >out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market. ------------------------------------------- It's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land. Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system as well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost won. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in return for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than 30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it was twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for rent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that. Some 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30% unemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies, no entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've saved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your kids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also buy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable property. Kill all of them! -RSW  >I want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more. >Is there a workable system for what you suggest?

Extra is kept for the future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that supports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If you want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a good job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something else. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with anybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a deep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger house or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan and community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public good or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in service to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid operators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy machine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their council is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't so hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could be already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been making the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the merry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted your 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones who always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a poor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed their greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been enslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we are called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house, paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with! I have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know what I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be let out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to live on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and their heirs. That would be worth it. Then to be able to die before they can do anything to me. That's a poor man's dream. Sleep tight, bastard landlords.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery, Gebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the finding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with an further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and 5% self-identifying themselves as ""bisexuals.""     (pp 69, 70)     As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read:  Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert? by Philip Nobile       Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a secret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.         But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin~ cultural influence.  His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000 men and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations, homosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as strawberry shortcake.         Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination.         Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey revisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of having been inolved in ""the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children.""  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.         Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a different book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette, Louisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission (""the coital alignment technique"") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes.  In the book Eichel contends that ""Kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality.""         If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports are, as the introduction boldly asserts, ""the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century.""  And if they are wrong, Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.       Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's detractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King may have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental patients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House, preyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another.         So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange people having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet. The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job.         As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional standing, no current university position, and no peer-review publications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom accomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited by others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no bachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate in 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: ""The Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media Effects.""       When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it was love at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti-  porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's Justice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the United States.         After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent of Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned  her to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel her $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but $734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe of child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust ler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general's pornography commission.)        When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986, it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That spring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house.         Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex cranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men's magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is Reisman's latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is putting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication.  ""This book is social dynamite,"" he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He especially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his syndicated column, he declared, ""It may just blow the sewer cap off Kinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50 aberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's 'research.'""       The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who molested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.       Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud:       Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children were the basis for Kinsey's conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.       Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost 15 years.       This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in promoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.       In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part of Kinsey's child sexuality research took place.        Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on child molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as Reisman said:          [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp counselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his marriage.""         As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  ""If you've ever been around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,"" he averred.  ""Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I didn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high school picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no, [sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?""        Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of Kinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientific modus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with a D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5 million related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he was no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism.         Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros, fascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of his bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though even his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.         Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: ""Some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal.""  Although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the documentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing like it in the literature.         Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose history took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and grandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys.  Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved following some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well as the speed and the capacity of climax.         What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey had reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle.  ""These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,"" he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.         Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of Kinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker. And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.         Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text.  There is no evidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a trace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail, Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge- - amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey's coauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research.       After frisking every ""the"" and ""and"" in both books, Reisman came up with what she believes are ""smoking"" sentences.  To establish Kinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that ""there is a hint"" in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey ""directed"" the orgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that ""writers...test their theories...by empirical study and statistical procedures.""  Then she combines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources ""were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved.""         Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy experimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog would not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over Pomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting Kinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of reasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the purpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming ""animal sex""-- Reisman asserts that a ""similar misrepresentation may yet apply to Kinsey's child sex experiments.""  Catch the ""may""!       Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: ""Kinsey, according to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things for himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit. Because he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of a sex offender?"" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their records.)        From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides, sperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed the legendary Kinsey.       Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey Institute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by telephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied Reisman's nasty imputations.  ""I don't understand the resistance of people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children,"" Gebhard said more in exasperation than anger.  ""That is where sex begins.  We were happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles commit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They wouldn't be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for directing experiments, that's absurd.  We never told any of our subjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly inappropriate.""         I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation.  ""I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and Kinsey watched it.""         As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in confidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and fathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual revelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss's history back in the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  ""We never divulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive,"" he says.         Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing ""the Kinsey practice of euphemizing incest.""  My offense was using the biblical variant ""lying with a near relative"" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for intercourse, ""lying with"" appears eight times in Genesis.         Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by Kinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the early '80s.  ""It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,"" he says.       Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.       Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman, and from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks ""the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people"" which, by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior, ""would open the way for the second and more difficult step-- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children).""         When I pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions, he said weakly, ""You don't think Kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey reports.""         Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of Kinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That's just what the country needs-- a House Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer or-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.

talk.politics.misc,20news-bydate-test/talk.politics.misc/178600,"The following statement was released on February 27,1992 by the Science & Environmental Policy Project  As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are  concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and  activists  groups and certain political leaders. This so called ""Earth Summit"" is  scheduled to convene in  Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of  global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on  the population of the United States and other industrialized nations. Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They  are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming  follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We  do not agree.  A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991,  confirms that there is  no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming  observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even  suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar  activity),  rather  than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the  global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880. Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that  the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming  cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record.  Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models. Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide  levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on  world food supply. We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth,  are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent  changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global  regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs,  standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences  falling on developing countries and the  poor.
